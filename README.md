# Endless gif generator

This is an example of how to create an endless, streaming gif in Node. Each frame is unique and streamed to the browser not unlike a movie.

Note it does not currently work in Safari 11 :(

[Live demo](http://hellohansel.apps.rainycode.com/live-demo.gif)

## Instructions

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

It should also work on Heroku as the `.buildpacks` and `Procfile` are set up.
